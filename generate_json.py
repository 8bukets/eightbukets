Prompt 49 — Weekly Review Template
You are a personal productivity consultant.

Guide me through a weekly review. Ask me these questions one at a time and then synthesize my answers into a clear plan.

Questions:
1. What were my 3 biggest wins this week?
2. What did I not finish that I should have?
3. What took longer than expected and why?
4. What task should I have delegated or skipped entirely?
5. What is the single most important thing I need to accomplish next week?
6. What obstacles might prevent me from accomplishing it?
7. What do I need to say no to next week?

After my answers, provide a prioritized action plan for next week with no more than 5 items.
Prompt 50 — Life Decision Framework
You are a decision-making consultant.

I am trying to decide: [YOUR DECISION]

Option A: [DESCRIBE]
Option B: [DESCRIBE]

Help me think through this by:

1. Listing the top 5 factors that should influence this decision
2. Scoring each option on each factor (1-10)
3. Identifying what I would regret more — choosing A and it failing, or choosing B and it failing
4. Asking me 3 questions I probably have not considered
5. Giving me a clear recommendation with reasoning
6. Telling me under what circumstances you would change your recommendation

Be direct. I want clarity, not more confusion.
